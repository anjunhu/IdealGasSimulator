## General info
The aim of this project is to design and implement an Interactive Ideal Gas Simulator that demonstrates the interplay of work and internal energy in thermodynamic systems, involving tools such as multiple I2C sensors, ADC, DAC and UART.
## Features
* ADC (analog to digital converter)\
*In this project, we will use the ADC to calculate the internal energy (Particle Kinetic Energy) of a box of gas from its internal temperature in Kelvins.
* I2C Sensor\

* DAC output
* Kalman Filter
* GUI with UART
